        <h1> Thermodynamic Model </h1>
        <i>Work in progress</i>
        <h2> Hamiltonian </h2>
        For this model a nearest neighbor approximation was used.
        The Hamiltonian of the system is calculated by summing all nearest neighbors interactions.
        Where A↔A, A↔B and B↔B refers to the interaction energy between these atoms.
        <h2> States </h2>
        The grid of atoms is represented as a 2d array at each position there is a either an atom A or an atom B. If
        <i>Move Vacancy</i> is chosen there is a single vacancy present in the grid.
